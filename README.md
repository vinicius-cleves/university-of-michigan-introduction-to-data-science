# university-of-michigan-introduction-to-data-science
This is my solution to the final project proposed on the course Intoduction to Data Science in Python offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera.

The task can be summurized as testing the following Hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. 

The data used was:
- Home sale prices for US cities
- List of university towns
- US GDP over time
